<h1>Django Project - Ya Yeat: Restaurant Randomizer</h1>
Live Demo: http://3.134.110.178/
<p>Many people have a hard time to decide what they should eat.</p>
<p> To reduce decision fatigue, this web application makes the decision by randomly picking a restaurant that is within a 5 mile radius.</p>
<p> This web application uses Django framework and Yelp API to generate a random restaurant.</p>
<p> A user can input a city or address in to the input feild and the app will send that information to Yelp's Api and return a list of restaurants found in a 5 mile radius from that input and randomly pick one to display</p>
